Hold on, I know you're scared but you're so close to Heaven
Eyes shut tight, just pretend you're like a feather
Float on the clouds together but don't look down, not ever
Don't ask why, just look out into forever
All this time you're just trying not to lose it
You can always learn to fly, you never do until you do it
Up high in the middle of nowhere
Don't know, but you know when you get there
Walk slow and low on a tight rope
Hope it last but you know, you never know
Take a chance we can dance up in mid air
Feels so good, I could die, but I don't care
Walk slow and low on a tight rope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know
You never know
We're just a step from fearless, reach out for me my dearest
Don't you cry, you don't know you're almost near it
All this time you're just trying not to lose it
You can always learn to fly, you never do until you do it
Up high in the middle of nowhere
Don't know, but you know when you get there
Walk slow and low on a tight rope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know
Take a chance we can dance up in mid air
Feels so good I could die, but I don't care
Walk slow and low on a tight rope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know
Oh, oh, you never know
You never know
Oh, oh, you never know
You never know
Up high in the middle of nowhere
Don't know, but you know when you get there
Walk slow and low on a tight rope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know
Take a chance we can dance up in mid air
Feels so good I could die, but I don't care
Walk slow and low on a tight rope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know
Up high in the middle of nowhere
Don't know, but you know when you get there
Walk slow and low on a tight rope
Hope I last but you know, you never know
Oh, oh, you never know
You never know
Oh, oh, you never know
You never know
